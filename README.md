## ABOUT

Frontend developer with over **8 years** of experience, worked in Agile teams from 2 to 10 members, both remotely and in
the office, and operating as a Team Lead for 2+ years now. I have experience in page load speed optimization, splitting the
monolithic app into micro frontend apps, CI/CD configuration, and building projects' architecture and infrastructure from
scratch. Expert in React, TypeScript, and JavaScript programming, passionate about going under their hood and solving
algorithmic challenges on LeetCode.
In addition to tech knowledge, I easily communicate with clients while figuring out precise product requirements,
managing my team’s tasks and performance, always sharing my insights, and listening to others to help us grow. My
hobbies are learning fundamental computer science components such as system design patterns, mentoring junior
colleagues, and checking out new techs and updates in the front-end industry.
